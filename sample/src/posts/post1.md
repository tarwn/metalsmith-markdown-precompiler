Hello world! This is a simple post I'm writing to share an image, and since I want that images look consistent on my blog, I am using a partial to define the markup.

{{> figure src="kitten.jpg" title="A kitten"}}

This kitten looks nice, or it doesn't?

I also take a video of him playing with a fuss.

{{> video id='v?42zZr2-d2'}}

That's all folks!
